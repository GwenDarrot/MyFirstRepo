Hi! I'm Gwen.
I am interested in everything that has to do with creativity, design and art.
My hobbies are spending time with my family, making plans with friends, drawing, illustration, video games, hiking, novels, manga, anime and traveling.
I am currently learning to program so that in the future I will be able to create anything from scratch and be able to carry out the entire process, both the development and design processes.
